# Decentralized Subscription Management

## Project Description

The Decentralized Subscription Management system is a blockchain-based solution that revolutionizes how subscription services are managed and payments are processed. Built on the Core Testnet 2, this smart contract system eliminates the need for traditional centralized payment processors by enabling direct, trustless transactions between subscribers and service providers.

The system allows users to create, manage, and cancel subscriptions autonomously while ensuring transparent, automated payment processing through smart contracts. Service providers can offer their services with guaranteed payment mechanisms, while subscribers maintain full control over their subscription lifecycle.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a truly decentralized ecosystem where subscription-based services can operate without relying on traditional financial institutions or centralized payment systems. We aim to:

- **Eliminate Intermediaries**: Remove the need for payment processors, reducing fees and increasing transparency
- **Empower Users**: Give subscribers complete control over their subscription data and payment schedules
- **Global Accessibility**: Enable subscription services to operate globally without geographical restrictions
- **Trustless Operations**: Ensure all transactions are executed automatically through smart contracts
- **Financial Sovereignty**: Allow both subscribers and service providers to maintain full control over their funds

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Subscription Creation**: Users can create subscriptions with customizable payment intervals and amounts
- **Automated Payment Processing**: Smart contract handles recurring payments automatically when due
- **Subscription Management**: Users can cancel subscriptions at any time with immediate effect
- **Earnings Withdrawal**: Service providers can withdraw their accumulated earnings securely

### Advanced Features
- **Flexible Payment Intervals**: Support for various subscription periods (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)
- **Multi-Service Support**: Single contract handles multiple service providers and subscription types
- **Payment Due Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of payment schedules and due dates
- **Balance Management**: Secure handling of service provider earnings with withdrawal capabilities
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive event emission for transaction tracking and analytics

### Security & Transparency
- **Access Control**: Robust permission system ensuring only authorized actions
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all input parameters
- **Gas Optimization**: Efficient contract design to minimize transaction costs
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history through blockchain immutability

- **Enterprise SLA**: Service level agreements and support infrastructure

### Long-term Vision
- **AI-Powered Optimization**: Machine learning for payment scheduling and fraud detection
- **Decentralized Identity**: Integration with decentralized identity solutions
- **Carbon Neutral Operations**: Offset mechanisms for environmental sustainability
- **Global Payment Rails**: Seamless integration with traditional payment systems

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Core Testnet 2 wallet with test tokens

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your private key to the `.env` file
3. Configure network settings in `hardhat.config.js`

### Deployment
```bash
# Compile contracts
npm run compile

# Deploy to Core Testnet 2
npm run deploy

# Run tests
npm test
```

### Usage
After deployment, the contract address will be saved in `decentralizedsubscriptionmanagement.json` for easy integration with frontend applications or other services.
